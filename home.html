        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <p>This was an assignment for CS1300 UI/UX. The goal was for students to gain experience 
          developing in React. We had general requirments (filtering, sorting, aggregating) but 
          could decide what our app was and the use case. I enjoyed developing with React and learned
          how to build my own web app from scratch.
        </p>

      <div class='section-plain' id="app">
        <h3>Application Goals:</h3>
        <p>My application is a dog walking website where users can browse through different dogs and
          decide which would be the best fit for them to walk. I was inspired by existing dog walking 
          mobile apps such as Rover, but wanted to make a web app. 
          <br>
          Users can filter through dogs to match their walking preferences in terms of dog size and 
          energy level. This brings value to users who want to walk dogs and get paid for it, as well 
          as for dog owners who neeed their dog walked when they are away at work or otherwise unable to.

        <h3>Usability Choices:</h3>
        <b>Usability</b>
        <li>Simple style with consistent information hierarchy</li>
        <li>Clearly delineated sections for intuitive information architecture</li>
        <br>
        <b>Learnability</b>
        <li>I included some instructional copy on the top so that first time users would know what the site is and how to use it</li>
        <li>Each section is clearly labeled with a header so that first time users uncerstand different sections</li>
        <li>Filters and sorting mechanisms are clearly highlighted at the top so first time users see the options available to them</li>
        <br>
        <b>Memorability</b>
        <li>Simple style makes it easy for users to remember how to use it</li>
        <br>
        <b>Efficiency</b>
